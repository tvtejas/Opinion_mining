The keyboard design is really poor. The silver topped keys with grey lettering are near invisible. The Function keys are numbered in miniscule font (that too in grey font). I think the regular designer went on a holiday while the keyboard was being designed.  I really would like to give it three stars only due to this huge factor in efficient usability. You need to have a light shining directly on the keyboard to see the keys properly.  But otherwise the machine is great.","Yes","B07HM7GNSZ","Not Deleted","Ryzen 3 + MS Office"

Slow startup. Took almost an hour to do initial set up. Overall there is a slowness. Opening apps and settings taking longer than usual.
Good timely delivery by amazon.
Will use for some days and try.
‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî
Review after 5 days:
Slowness continues
Takes lot of time while performing certain basic tasks. Ex below
1. Right click from desktop and opening ‚ÄòNew‚Äô submenu takes around 30 seconds
2. Opening multiple browser tabs in chrome makes system very slow
3. Settings tab takes around 20 secs to open.
Overall not satisfied with the performance
The positive is battery life.

After reading all those good reviews I decided to go with It. But Its terrible. First thing that I notice is the display. Its plain bad.  Not at all HD as described. It looks like 360p at the most.
The pages are all pixelate.  The display really looks like what people would have used in the eighties,  when Steve Jobs and such visioneries were working  on it.  But It seems this product is yet to move on from that and its stuck to this Damn which might have looked OK 35 years back. Its still under 10 days replacement criteria but the Guys at amazon are not responding well. Then I discovered the second problem, this time one of the keys on keyboard does not seem to work and when I checked,  Its damaged and what looks like a hardware issue. When I contacted amazon, I was told to update the drivers from HP site. Tell me, how can you fix what is clearly a Hardware issue by downloading softwares!!! This IS THEIR SUPPORT or if you may call it that.
Yet I installed all the drivers and still hardly any improvement.
My Question is - Amazon, What is this!

before battery dead my experience with this laptop!!
1.AMD RYZEN 3 is good for light gaming, editing and for browsing,and watching movies or online shows.
2.BATTERY BACKUP:- if you are gaming give you 1 hour battery backup.document editing or video editing give you almost1:30 to 2 hr,and for browsing give you 3 to 4 hr and last watching online movies give you 4 hr,and watching downloaded movies gives to battery life of 5 hr.
!!BEWARE!! who is planning to buy this laptop after seeing 13 hour battery backup.
3:-DISPLAY is the main con of this laptop..ok ok type display,only hd(720p) in 2018.
4:-SOUND:- sound output of the machine is good but I'm using DFX ENHANCER,with DFX enhancer sound output is great.
5:- PERFORMANCE:-over all laptop performed well if you add m.2 ssd (I added samsung evo 860 evo) for better performance and more 4 GB or more ram(1 extra ram slot available).I added (8+8=16gb)crucial ram coz system supports dual channel ram.after upgrade laptop boot time is drastically reduced from 2 minute to 8 sec...GAMING experience with this laptop is good like PUBG,CS GO,FORTNITE,FARCRY,
BATTLEFIELD 1,ROCKET LEAGE,GTA 5,MORTAL COMBAT and more...overall 3.5 rating out of 5.
6:-PROBLEM:-within 5 month laptop battery dead, not charging,HP service also sucks!! complaint register on 10th May but still I'm waiting for technician...they are giving same excuse  same time..sir,your problem solved within 2 days but it's already passed more than two days...I already attached pics...so never recommending hp product to anyone else..they are not able to provide services in Hyderabad metro city.. don't buy any hp product... NEVER TRUST A GUY WHO IS TELLING HOW GOOD HP SERVICE....THIS IS EXAMPLE OF HP SERVICE..","Yes","B07H38T3PG","Not Deleted","Ryzen 3"

After 8 years of using a Mac I decided to return back to HP with my first time using Windows 10. I must say I am impressed with its performance so far. The good thing is I can upgrade the RAM which I plan on doing soon simply because I'm a tech geek but in no way does the installed RAM make the laptop lag in any way. The Ryzen 3 processor is also nice and slick too. Just make sure to routinely update the preinstalled device drivers and in order to make sure you get all the device improvements.

Brought it on Great Indian Festival Sale at 23k.
I usually use it for Coding and currently using Arch Linux with GNOME 3.32
Pros:
1. Comes with official Windows 10 Home Lifetime license
2. Battery backup is good. Can last for 4 hrs with continuous usage.
3. In-Built Speaker sound quality and loudness is good.
4. Comes with APU. Compute intensive programs can benefit from it.
5. Keys are good. Less noise.
6. In-Built Camera Quality is good.
7. Supports M.2 SSD. Works concurrently with SATA hard disk.
Cons:
1. Ram is 3.6 GB. Where Windows 10 use 2.4 GB on standby.
2. Hard Disk is slow. So, boot time is long.
3. F.16 BIOS update broke support for several Linux Distros.
4. Due to new Vega Graphics its hard to set up several Linux Distro.
In my opinion this laptop is not recommended for Gaming because of it's limited VRAM.
One may reduce boot time by loading the OS in a SSD.
Games can be played with a RAM upgrade.","Yes","B07H38T3PG","Not Deleted","Ryzen 3"

It solved the problem for a about a week and then went back to its usual slow self.","Yes","B07H38T3PG","Not Deleted","Ryzen 3"

Games can be played casually but not as regular basis... Ram is 4gb, so sometimes it used to hang... Better to put extra 4 gb so that there left no hanging issue. Others editing work can be done smoothly... AUTO CAD 2007 is running smoothly... Even racing game okay but battle field 4 is a bit problem... battery doesnot last more than 2 hrs that to on heavy heavy use it lasts only 1:30 hrs... Screen is awesome. HP service given is good. Inbuilt Microsoft office is there. Even in built Microsoft is awesome... Donot use for heavy games... use only for office work","Yes","B07HM7GNSZ","Not Deleted","Ryzen 3 + MS Office"

What attracted me the most to this laptop was that the extra RAM and M.2 slots with which we can upgrade both.
I never really believed in the claim of battery life to be 13 hours. Those who did are those who i consider naive. It lasts for around 3-4 hours of continuous use which i think is fair enough.
Day to day apps like MS word and ppt and pdf readers are working perfectly fine as of now. My old sony had become really slow in opening those apps.
However, my only gripe as of now is its horrendous display. The screen resolution and viewing angle is pathetic. If you like HD stuffs, please don't bother with this laptop. The screen is not that immersive and over that it is highly reflective, so you can't use it outside in daylight.
As a budget option, it is ok, and remember, there is this option to upgrade to SSD and upgrade the RAM.","Yes","B07H38T3PG","Not Deleted","Ryzen 3"

My usage is usual browsing / movies / bit of office work ( ssh terminals / C programming etc ).
However the benefit in gaming is evident - its much better now and doesn't hang/crash.
Overall - warranty support is so far good - HP support does hear and try to solve the problem.
I guess its imperative that extended warranty needs to be purchased.

I was expecting the performance to be on the slower side considering that it only has a 4GB RAM on it, but I am pleasantly surprised to see that it is quite fast. However, I will still add another 8GB RAM to make it a total of 12GB, cause that more RAM the better it is.
Will also upgrade to the 240GB WD Green M.2 SSD and migrate the OS to it, cause it will definitely boost the performance.
Having said all that, I would certainly recommend this laptop cause right out of the box it is great and good value for money. Plus it is highly upgradeable as compared to other laptops in it category and price point.

This product - HP 15 AMD Ryzen 3 15.6-inch Laptop (4GB/1TB HDD/Windows 10 Home/Sparkling Black/2.04 kg - is being sold promising that it has 13 hours long battery. Well, that is absolutely false. I am a writer. So, my basic needs (applications) on a laptop/computer are - Ms Word, Ms Excel, Paint, Google Chrome, Firefox Browser. I barely watch movies/YouTube on it. I don't play games on it. But, it's battery exhausts in just 5 to 6 hours. Talking about other features, it is very quite fast. If you have got fast data connection, websites will load in a blink. Sound quality is great. When I received this laptop, I played a few songs on it. It was an awesome experience.

Just one fear I have is the heating issue of this processor. It heats up too much especially when we do multi tasking for little longer duration. I am hopeful that it'll not create any problem for longer run.
Its performance is almost equivalent to i3 but graphical performance like medium load gaming works even better on this one than the i3 processor, but heating is a big time problem. If we do multi tasking especially playing games or watching movies or videos for long time then laptop heat up much. Once I had experience weird problem too when it got too much heat it play weird sound for few minutes and then restarted.

(my Bios are upto date as per vendor).For Linux Environment  Wifi will not Supported. You need buy a seperate wifi adaptor dont buy this if you are intend to use for Ubuntu or Kali Linux or any linux environment, Graphics  managable just ok.you will only get 250+MB video Ram which is worst part , you can't work o  adobe programs properly.

Has some Graphics driver problem which supplier doesn't accept when i gave feedback. You will get bsod error when some applications use graphics (thats not application problem at all ) purely manufacturer defect which they don't accept.

Initially it was slow and was taking around 2 minutes to fully load windows 10. After reading rivews and suggestions, i bought additional 4gb ram and 128 gb ssd and installed it. (How to do it yourself and about installation process, you can find in YouTube)
Now its booting really fast. Windows load within 25 seconds.

So far very satisfied with the product.
Rest all your doubts on AMD, this one is a deal clincher at the given festival price point.
Pros
Total value for money at 24k- all ports available including DVD RW
The Ryzen 3 is good, no problems with that- comparable to i5 IMHO, Can handle videos and games smoothly
4GB RAM is just about enough- but maybe less for W10
The key board and touchpad are convinient to use
Sound is loud and good
Cons
Battery backup is just about 2.5hrs max- 3 Cell only
Slow to bootup- Windows 10 maybe
Lot of bloatware, but you can uninstall
You get what you pay(YGWUP)
Plain Jane looks
The screen resolution is poor- only HD
Keyboard not easy to use at night/ low light
Suggestions for upgrade
Go for SSD -120 GB on Amazon  for 2.5K
RAM needs a boost - 8GB maybe
Screen replacement to FHD
Do this and you may leave light behind!
All in all, if you are looking for a loaptop to surf the web, do weekend office work and play games ocassionally and want a budget laptop go for it, you will surely not be disappointed.","Yes","B07H38T3PG","Not Deleted","Ryzen 3"

Perfect for college students and professionals who rely on MS Office.","Got it for 24k in a sale.
Initially, I was using Lenovo z500 which has i5 and dedicated graphics card and surprisingly this laptop beats it in the benchmark. So I can say for sure that its better choice than i3 based laptops any time.
4GB of ram is not enough if you want lag-free performance, I upgraded it with extra 4GB of ram and 120GB SSD and after that programs like Photoshop, Android Studio starts up almost instantly, on HDD it used to take at least minute or so and on my Lenovo, it takes significantly longer. There is no competition between my old i5 rig and this one, Ryzen 3 is owning i5 :D
Battery Backup is advertised as 10+ hrs but in the real world use, it is giving me 4-5 hrs of web browsing+programming+video playback. Still best in this range.
The screen is not FHD and considering price it was expected, it's good enough. I am not a gamer so can't say about its refresh rate but for my use Screen is not bad for me at least.
The keyboard is very good, very good for programmers.
Speakers are decent, not too good, not too bad.
M.2 Slot is a big plus. Just Install SSD and see this thing blazing through anything and everything you throw at it.
Ports: You get plenty of ports, USB ports seemed bit tight though. Addition of USB Type C would have been great.
Trackpad is good too.","Yes","B07H38T3PG","Not Deleted","Ryzen 3"

Hardrive is extremly slow. Though it shows it 5400rpm but blevive it works like a 10 years old harddrive worls.
Boot is extreamy slow. Takes around 1 minute to turned on completely. (i have. Removed AV and HP product software which comes preinstalled)
Copy process is also slow.
Good part is : you have M.2 slot. So you can M.2 SSD hardrive for OS and believe me you will see more than 10 times difference in boot time as compared to his own disk.
Second good thing is that it has 2 memory slots where you can add up to 16gb memory.

If you can buy this laptop under 23k , just go for it. You won‚Äôt regret it. There are many upgrade options available for this laptop So that you can improve the performance of this laptop. I didn‚Äôt find any other laptop where I can upgrade to Nvme m.2 SSD.
So I was testing my laptop for the last few weeks without the upgrade and it was performing well. But there was some issues with the gaming, Photoshop and continues browsing with many tabs opened.
Then I upgraded to WD green m.2 240Gb SSD (sata speed) and migrate the Windows OS to the SSD with the WD OS Clone tool which is available on the WD website. It did shows a significant improvement in the performance. The browsing, photoshop cc speed increased but not the gaming fps. Bought it form Md computers (online) for Rs 3500.
If you have the budget go for Samsung 970 evo( Samsung 860 evo for low price).
The boot time was reduced to 10sec, for HDD it was around 26sec , for SSD it was 16 sec.
I tried to play GTA 5 on SSD , the loading time was reduced but it‚Äôs not playable even at lowest graphics settings.
Then I upgraded the ram since 3Gb of my ram was always used by the OS, So I installed ADATA 4GB DDR4 2400Mhz ram for Rs 3000 , it really improved overall performance of the laptop. Ram is now running on Dual channel.
The laptop came with Samsung M471A5244CB0-CTD Ram which was capable of running at 2666Mhz ,but the laptop motherboard only support 2400Mhz Ram. I opt the help of HP forum and a computer expert to find the best compatible ram for the laptop because there is a chance of some compatibility issues.
I would say if you are buying any other ram other than ADATA  AD4S2400J4G17-R , Make sure that you take the laptop to a technician so that even if the ram doesn‚Äôt support you still won‚Äôt loose your money.
I tried to buy online, but if it doesn‚Äôt support means I can‚Äôt return the product.
Now I can play GTA 5 with average 30fps at low settings,No photoshop editing lag ,applying filters and other effects.
Pros:
AMD RYZEN 3 performance is very good
Can be upgraded to nvme m.2 SSD (Samsung 970 evo the best)
No overheating issues.
Good viewing angle.
Activated windows 10 Home
Fast charging

Nothing to beat. It makes it all the more better deal as it comes preloaded with Win10. At 25k deal in festive sale a great price.
Performance : The new AMD ryzen processors with Vega graphics match and can even beat their Intel counterparts in performance per watt. However I have no idea why HP and all other manufacturers spoil this performance with Win10 bloatware loaded on an ancient 1TB HDD. Even for a little more a 120GB SDD is so much better. So here 3 stars only for not having SDD in 2018. Have ordered an SDD and have to discard the HDD
The worst however is the screen. I don‚Äôt think I have seen more worst screen in my life. My 10 year old Vaio VGN-N31M/W had such an awesome screen. And this is what we have in 2018? Found the reason: this laptop display is 6 bit colour with RBG model. Have to give it 2 stars only !

Got it for 22k. 3k extra for 4gb ram Module as 4 gb is not sufficient for Windows 10. Many who complained about laptop being slow should upgrade to 8 gb. It has changed the response drastically. No more hang ups. Adding a ssd could do wonders though have not added one yet.
Edit. Finally decided to add a ssd drive. bought WD Green 120 GB M2 drive for Rs. 2280 from amazon. Added it myself. Now the speed difference is apparent in test results. system boots in 15 secs as compared to 40 secs earlier. responses have become much better. the reading speeds are good but writing not so great. I would suggest if you can spend more go for WD blue or Samsung Evo 860. they are more expansive but have writing speeds in the range of 500MB/S. WD Green is for budget users and I feel satisfied with the performance for the price paid.
Edit 2 - Many were complaining about battery backup not as expected. Initially when i was using wifi and at moderate brightness i was getting 4-5 hours max. but once you turn off wifi and use it for moderate works like watching movies(not ultra 4k resolution but upto 1080p or 720p) the backup is around 6-7 hours. and while working on word excel etc backup is up to 10 hours usually. Turning off WiFi saves a lot of battery.","Yes","B07H38T3PG","Not Deleted","Ryzen 3"

The laptop looks quite good and also I am able to open laptop with one hand which is great  .
Coming to display it's average and can't expect more .
The processor amd 3 ryzen 2200 u is good and easily comparable to intel i3 7th Gen .
4gb Ram is enough for basic tasks but you definitely need to upgrade to 8gb if planning to do anything more and trust me the performance after that would be great .
The additional bonus is m2 slot for SSD , you can install a SSD along with ur 1tb HDD and install windows in SSD and the the magic and speed .
One thing I did not like in the laptop is the sound , its low compared to other standards and the sound cracks  in high pitch voices , I ve tried updating the drivers and checking sound settings but no use .
Still it's not very noticeable so I passed it and did not return the laptop.
If ur looking for a upgradable laptop with good processor under a budget go for it , but only buy it in a sale , never pay 30 k for this .
If budget permits definitely concider upgrading to ssd and atleast 8gb more ram , it will give significant speed boost .

mcafee seems to be coming preloaded on a lot of laptops these days and it does eat up a lot of cpu and disk utilization and makes the laptop slow/laggy. need to uninstall mcafee and install an alternative like eset or avast.
noticed that it doesn't have an easily removable battery (like how most conventional laptops do). one probably needs to unscrew and remove the entire base to access the battery and other components like the ram and hdd. so i wonder if the battery is easily user replaceable... will know once i open the base panel off in a few days.
also wanted to upgrade the RAM, but unable to get the exact ram spec (tried the bios and speccy) and it doesn't show a brand name. i guess i'll have to physically open up the base to get access to the hardware and see what i can do about it.
definitely would do much much better with 8 gigs or ram and an ssd.","Yes","B07H38T3PG","Not Deleted","Ryzen 3"

I will provide some step wise alterations to be made that will speed up the laptop.
1.Uninstall Mcafee. Windows defender is capable enough to protect from normal threats unless malicious sites are opened by user. In that case use AVG . its pretty light on RAM
2. Then go on control center - windows update and keep running updates,restarts and boot ups until it shows that no further update is available. Similarly do it for HP assistant. It will download all the drivers required for the laptop. This ll eat some 2 hours of time but very necessary.
3. Once all updates done - Go to task manager. From there to start up and disable which ever process you don't use like Microsoft one drive etc.
4. In task manager go on view tab and update refresh speed to the highest.
5. In start bar in computer/ windows management manually update processor speed to 100% while on battery or on AC power.
After all these setting you will find laptop boot up real nice in under 30 sec and no lag while operating in multiple windows or videos or heavy word/ excel files.

Do on believe those who say this laptop is slow, the Ryzen 3 processor is way better than i3 in terms of overall performance and Gaming performance. Those who are complaining about slow performance, it's because Windows 10 is a very heavy interface and needs a lot of RAM, it's an issue on all Windows 10 laptops and is worse on i3 processors.

And coming to the laptop its amazing even Better than my expectations.AMD Ryzen 3 awesome processor definitely lot better than i3 series.Its good for gaming im using it for almost 3 days its performance was very smooth and quick , im starting to wondering how they gave it for 28000. dell ryzen 3 laptop are giving it for 40000.
Ryzen is giving pure graphical performance.
If ur looking for midrange gaming laptop go for its best in this segment. Some guys are giving bad reviews about that dont get confused.If u utilities its full hardware and software facilities thn ur gng to love this.ill give some additional information
Pros:
1 Amd ryzen processor its have better multi thread performance when compare to intel i3good for gaming
2 Performance u can run highend game's in this.if u upgrade ur ram to 8 GB it will run like a pro
3 you have m2 slot for SSD
4 Fast charging it takes around 45 min to charge 50% and battery is inbuilt
5 its coming with Windows 10 life time validity.
6 Comes with DVD drive and smooth finished coating.
7 Light weight only 2 kg
8 Price Best in segment.
Cons:
1 just a HD display not FHD
2 Battery last upto 7 to 8hrs apprx in gaming  6 to 7hrs
3 Yeah its Heating up little bit but not much.if ur well-known guy abt processor u come to know that heating and battery fast draining its a major issues for AMD.its default but im not worrying abt that .intel also have a heating problems and Ryzen is a next level processor from amd its handling heat and battery quite good compared to other AMD.laptop so don't worry abt heating.
I strongly recommend this for u too","Yes","B07H38T3PG","Not Deleted","Ryzen 3"

So average speed of delivery. Now as far as laptop is concerned,it is top notch as long as you dont have sky rocketing expectations.. This is the best laptop below 30k.
Pros:
1-Ryzen 3 is pretty fast in CPU performance and miles ahead of intel UHD 620/630 in GPU performance.
2-Handles all the regular work very well, plays 4k video in youtube without any stutter. I use it for day to day purpose.
3-It can handle gaming quite well(at 720p obviously) if you add another 4/8gb of ram as 4gb ram is quite low for playing recent games. 4gb ram is not even adequate for windows 10 nowdays ,leave aside gaming. So if you want good stutter free performance, get atleast extra 4gb ram.
4-I have used it for emulation purpose as well and have got very good performance in pcsx2 & cemu( both of which are very cpu intensive). Intel doesnt play pcsx2/cemu well enough even at lowest settings. Intel gpu is not supported by cemu. So if you are into playing retro games and have a limited budget,this is your best budget option.
5- Its very premium looking laptop with sparkling black finish.
6-Has two USB 3.1 ports which provide very fast transfer speed.
7-Has M.2 port(which is much faster than HDD) for upgrading storage which i am planning to do. Shifting the OS to M.2 will give serious boost in performance. Most budget laptop dont have this facility.
8-Metallic finish around keyboard which gives it premium look.
9-Pretty loud speakers
10-No heating(gets just little warm on full load)
11-Good screen
12-Not very heavy- its 2kg which isnt much considering that its a 15.6 inch screen.
13-Charger is very light weight. It becomes important when you are carrying it daily for 1 hour on your back.
Cons-
1-Pathetic webcam, but thats normally found in most laptop. This is one thing i dont understand that why manufacturers dont add good webcam. Nowdays we have 20-24 megapixel cam in mobiles, so why not add a good webcam in laptop?
2-Not so great viewing angles on screen. Also screen is very reflective,so causes problem in day time as lots of reflections create distraction.
3- Maybe this problem is with my unit only but USB ports are very tight. I have to struggle to insert or remove any USB cable etc.
4-Not soo great battery life as has been claimed in the description. Even when i have used in most economic way possible , i get around 6-7 hours battery life. Though it is much better than normal laptop, but still much less than claimed 13 hrs battery life. Maybe it can be acheived in future by optimization of BIOS or driver.
5-Wobbling of screen when it is carried in hand.
Overall, its a fantastic laptop for the price. You will be pretty happy if you dont have skyrocketing expectations.","Yes","B07H38T3PG","Not Deleted","Ryzen 3"
