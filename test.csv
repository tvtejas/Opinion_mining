Pros:
Light weight ,screen, sound and battery is good.
Cons:
Slow performance sometimes even when nothing runs ,Noisy fan,
Though its not relevant,more space near the mouse pad is uncomfortable for small hand people.It hurts when using for long time.
Looks like easily breakable .I think HP was better for this price.","No","B07FBYG8Y7","Not Deleted","Platinum Grey"

This laptop has delivered on all of these objectives. However, the one caveat is this: the laptop comes with a 1 TB mechanical hard drive that is clearly the bottleneck of this system. I replaced this hard drive within a few weeks of purchasing this laptop due to debilitating performance. I installed a value priced solid state hard drive from a major manufacturer and the performance of this laptop was instantly improved. I would not recommend this laptop unless you plan to replace the hard drive with an SSD.

Bt after 1 months of using this one keypad switch was partially broken and also the camera quality got much poor than the previous one. I called lenovo Customer care bt they said that this camera quality is normal and the damage of keypad switch is not in my warranty. So they can't do anything.

But as soon as I got to know that it is just HD 1366x768. It was a shock to me.
Generally I dont prefer buying a product on launching without knowing its review, I just tried it on first time and its paid off badly.
But the trust I had on Lenovo product saved me.
The laptop is stylish with good finishing.
It is less weight and 180 degree hinge is nice.
All Hardware configuration is Awesome.
Dolby sound is good. I like the keypad and touchpad superb.
setup is easy with windows 10. it has 1 year McAfee subscription which is a surprise.
Finally with the Prime Day benefit I got 15% discount on the price of 45K which is great.
So it is worth the money.
